- **Tool Calls**: [count] - batch operations where possible
- **Knowledge Reuse**: [X%] - how much prior session knowledge was leveraged
- **Bootstrap Time**: [X minutes] - time from start to productive work
- **Objective Completion Rate**: [X/Y objectives] - success percentage vs estimates

4. **NEXT_SESSION_PLAN.md Creation**:
   - Strategic planning for next [PROJECT_TYPE] development session
   - Priority ranking based on production readiness and edge case handling
   - Clear success criteria for [PROJECT_SPECIFIC_GOALS]
   - Consideration of [PROJECT_COMPLEXITY] and testing requirements

### ðŸ’¾ **Session Export**

5. **Session Summary Export**: Create comprehensive session documentation in `~/.claude/logs/`:
   - Session date, duration, and primary [PROJECT_DOMAIN] objectives
   - Major achievements with [PROJECT_SPECIFIC] improvements and edge case handling
   - Challenges encountered with [DOMAIN_CHALLENGES] and resolution strategies
   - Production readiness improvements and testing framework enhancements
   - Performance optimization results for [PERFORMANCE_CONTEXT]
   - Strategic recommendations for future [PROJECT_DOMAIN] development

### ðŸ”„ **Git Flow Management**

6. **Repository Management**: Following proper git flow:
   - Commit all documentation updates with descriptive messages
   - Push to feature branch (not main) with proper branch naming
   - Ensure clean working directory and proper change isolation
   - Consider PR creation for complex changes requiring review
